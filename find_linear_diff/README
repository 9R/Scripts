This script attempts to find a linear history for multiple versions
of a file.  Run it with all the versions on the command line and it
will output the sequence from oldest to newest version based on diffs
between the files.

It works by diff'ing the files and tries to find a set of minimal changes.
To distinguish old from new, it favours additions over deletions.
